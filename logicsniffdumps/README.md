throw some logic sniffs here for DSlogic if others are interested in having a look.
.bin is output of bytes into a binary, for easier searching and working with.
.dsl is full sniff save for use with dslogic software, ablity to open without the hardware if wish to play.

in 7z split due to 24mb limit on github. use dsview to open the sniffs. https://www.dreamsourcelab.com/download/
