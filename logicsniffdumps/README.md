throw some logic sniffs here for DSlogic if others are interested in having a look.
.bin is output of bytes into a binary, for easier searching and working with.
.dsl is full sniff save for use with dslogic software, ablity to open without the hardware if wish to play.

in 7z split due to 24mb limit on github. use dsview to open the sniffs. https://www.dreamsourcelab.com/download/

deleted ones here due to forgot to change threshold from 1.0v on workbench pc did capture on. redone 1.6v threshold.

is boot then into modbo menu then 10ish delay before save ps1 screen fix on. clearly seen in the logic software, is some movement on bits without oe operation before bytes output, prehaps trigger to take note of bytes? not sure. matches the idea had lead and trigger idea "smart" style ps2 chips do.
