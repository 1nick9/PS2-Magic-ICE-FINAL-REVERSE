so i happen to get into contact with summ0ne from the ps2 homebrew days and he happily shared the sources for the h2o.
so here they are for all to enjoy. both the final sx28 code and also his redesign mcu sources and gerbers. 
this is super exciting :)

the sx28 code is only ment for restbump sx28. i have started porting reverse over to it and made a f=tr code, however in current state u will not be able to use on usa v14 due to way detects v14 usa is bridge on f and one of the flipflop. also seems h=rw is unusable on pal/usa though code there as part of mechacon patch route if h is set, so connected. assumes consoles is jap.

i plan to alter this up for prehaps predefined flash config so can use f=tr or even h=rw without worries for all modes.

some quick testing, the dev1 booting is much more stable and with new commenting the payload is altered from final ice.


very big thankyou to summ0ne for happily sharing these files :) much respect man, thankyou.
